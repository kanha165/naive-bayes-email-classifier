#  Naive Bayes Email Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using the **Naive Bayes Algorithm**.  
It analyzes the text of an email and predicts whether the message is legitimate or spam based on training data.

---

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** can be applied to build an intelligent email spam detection system.  
The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails using the **Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier**.

**Key Features:**
- Classifies email text as **Spam** or **Not Spam**
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** for text processing
- Built with **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy**
- Easy to train, test, and visualize results in Jupyter Notebook
